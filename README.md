This repository explores the factors that affect covid cases and also gives information on which age groups are most affected in terms of infection of the virus. I was able to observe how like any virus, COVID-19, although prominent throughout the year, begins to thrive and affect more people during the colder times of the year. The dataset was called "COVID-19 Cases in Toronto" and was taken from the Open Data Toronto Portal.   

It is organised as follows...

Under outputs, there is the PDF that I will submit along with the RMD so that anyone is able to see my code and the References.Bib file that was used for my in-text citations and references at the end of my paper. Under inputs, I have my raw data that was taken from the portal and worked with for this paper.
